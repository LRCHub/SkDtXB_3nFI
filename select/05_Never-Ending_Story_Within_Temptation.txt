Armies have conquered and fallen in the end
Kingdoms have risen, then buried by sand
The Earth is our mother, she gives and she takes
She puts us to sleep in her light we'll awake
We'll all be forgotten, there's no endless fame
But everything we do, It's never in vain

We're part of a story, part of a tale
We're all on this journey, no one's to stay
Where ever it's going?
What is the way?

Forests and deserts, rivers, blue seas
Mountains and valleys, nothing here stays
While we think we witness, we're part of the scene
This never-ending story, where will it lead to?
The earth is our mother, she gives and she takes
But she's also a part, a part of the tale

We're part of a story, part of a tale
We're all on this journey, no one's to stay
Oh where is it going?
What is the way?

We're part of a story, part of a tale
Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane
No one remembers how it began

We're part of a story, part of a tale
We're all on this journey, no one's to stay
Oh where is it going?
What is the way?

We're part of a story, part of a tale
Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane
No one remembers how it began
